In this project, we practice Git, the use of GitHub, and also HTML.
In it, we create the HTML structure of a website about culinary recipes. Within the body, we learn to use different tags, such as h1, h3, ordered lists, unordered lists, and how to incorporate links and images.
We also use Git from the console, linked with GitHub.
