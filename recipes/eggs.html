    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Use your air fryer to fry eggs if you are in a hurry and need a quick
      on-the go-breakfast. Cut and shape your foil the night before and let your
      air fryer do the work for you while your coffee brews in the morning. No
      ramekin required! If you increase your foil size to 8x10 inches you can
      cook 2 eggs at a time.
